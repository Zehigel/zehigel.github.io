        <h1 class="about-title">Heya! I’m Olli, ui/ux designer, illustrator and graphic designer based
          in the lovely Irenental in Austria.</h1>
        <div class="about-content">
          <p>For the last couple of years, I’ve been focusing on improving my
            skills in various scopes of design trying to dig deeper into
            several directions to find out what fits best for me. Doing that,
            at some point I realized that once I started finding those fields
            I wanna work in, the search itself is exactly what fulfills me.
            Not to focus just on one scope, but to focus on all of them and
            improve wherever I can, reaching out to many companies from all
            over the world, have learnings from various collaborations, that’s
            what is pure delight for me.<br>
            Living in Austria with my partner and photography genius Johanna,
            I got the perfect contrast to my daily business. I love to stay in
            the woods, travelling around with my friends as well as playing
            boardgames with my familiy and enjoy a beauteous living together.</p><br>
