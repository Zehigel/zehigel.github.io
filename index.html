        <h1 class="post-title">Better Collaboration: 5 Steps to being friends with designers</h1>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>In my earlier days, it used to be very stressful for me when it
          came time to hand off my web designs to the developer.<br>
          When I received the drafts and first builds, there was plenty of
          stuff I had to specify again in detail, and I always felt like,
          <strong>why the hell can’t devs just see what I see and code everything
          the way I gave it to them?</strong><br>
          I guess a lot of designers feel that way, but it’s not just the
          designers. Developers face similar issues. That’s why I’ll focus
          on a couple of points that will greatly simplify collaboration
          with designers.</p><br>
          <h3>1. Align the language</h3>
          <p>A very important point I quickly realized when working at
          Runtastic was that it’s essential to take a closer look at all
          the terminology that emerged during the collaboration and to
          clearly define it in your team.<br>
          It seems crazy when debating important content, but everyone
          wants to describe the same things in different words. This only
          wastes time, and things are still unclear after meetings.</p><br>
          <br>

          <p>And since different designations for similar components are used
          on various platforms, additional caution is necessary.<br>
          For example, the top navigation bar of a mobile app is called
          Navigation Bar on iOS, but it is a Toolbar on Android, which
          leads me to the next topic …</p><br>
